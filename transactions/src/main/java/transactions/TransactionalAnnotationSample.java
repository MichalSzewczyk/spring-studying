/**
 * Created by Micha≈Ç Szewczyk on 2017-02-03.
 * Transactional - is an annotation used to mark whole class or method. For classes and methods marked with this annotation
 *      Spring will perform automation management features. By using Transactional annotation we receive possibility to run
 *      transactions in declarative way, instead of programmatic. Declarative means, that the only thing, which is important
 *      for us, is business logic of transaction. Spring will take care of transaction management. All we have to do is to
 *      provide transaction advice (using AOP) via XML configuration in spring context.
