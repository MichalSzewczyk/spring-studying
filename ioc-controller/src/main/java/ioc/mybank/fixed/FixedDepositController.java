/**
 * Created by Micha≈Ç Szewczyk on 2017-02-02.
 * <p>
 * 1. Add fixedDepositService as an argument of constructor or setter method, instead of instantiating directly.
 * 2. Now we can use FixedDepositController as a Spring component.
 * 3. Information about objects used by this class, and dependencies between them are included in configuration metadata
 * which is included in beans.xml
 * There are also other ways of supplying metadata:
 * a) via xml files
 * b) via Java annotations
 * c) via Java code
